This Streamlit app was developed by 
students of the "Technical Information 
Design" bachelor program ([Bachelor 
Technisches Informationsdesign](https://www.hs-merseburg.de/studium/studiengaenge/technisches-informationsdesign/)) in the 
"Usability Engineering" module during 
the winter semester of 2024/2025 at 
Merseburg University of Applied Sciences. 

The app displays dataset recommendations 
on a map. The datasets stem from
the [umwelt.info](https://umwelt.info/) 
platform.

The app was tested with Python 3.11. 
In your virtual Python environment install
by issuing:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
